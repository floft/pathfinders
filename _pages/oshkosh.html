<p>The Cascade Eagles had a wonderful time attending the 2009 Pathfinder International Camporee held August 11-15, 2009, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. This 5-day event was sponsored by the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventist.</p>

<p>The theme was "Courage to Stand" and the evening programs featured drama and music based on the Bible Book of Esther.</p>

<p>Attending this event provided youth the experience of meeting other Pathfinders from all over the world and growing spiritually by participating in a variety of classes, worships, and activities designed to encourage youth to grow closer to God.</p>

<p>We are now looking ahead to the 2014 Oshkosh International Camporee.</p>
