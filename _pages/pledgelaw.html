The Pathfinder Pledge &amp; Law is an important part of Pathfinders.<br />
Thousands of Pathfinders each year learn and choose to abide<br />
by the requirements of the Pathfinder Pledge and Law<br />
for the sole purpose of growing closer to their fellow<br />
men and women, and to their Creator.</div>

<p><b>Pathfinder Pledge and Law:</b></p>
<p>By the grace of God, I will be pure, and kind, and true. I will keep the Pathfinder Law. I will be a servant
of God and a friend to man.</p>
<p>The Law is for me to:<br />
Keep the morning watch<br />
Do my honest part<br />
Care for my body,<br />
Keep a level eye<br />
Be courteous and obedient<br />
Walk softly in the sanctuary,<br />
Keep a song in my heart,<br />
Go on God's errand.</p>
